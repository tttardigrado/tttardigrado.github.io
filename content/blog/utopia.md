My Computational Complexity exam is next week. I should definitely be
studying instead of writing this, but here I am, procrastinating in the
most roundabout way: writing a random blog post that (probably) no one
is going to read.

While skimming through Sanjeev Arora’s lecture notes, I stumbled upon 
this phrase:

> If P = NP, then the world would be mostly a Utopia.

Has anyone ever turned that idea into a story? A world where P = NP?
Think about it, there are plenty of short stories that act as vehicles 
for philosophical ideas (the ones that come to my mind are Le Guin’s 
"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas", Chiang’s "Story of Your Life",
and practically anything that Borges ever wrote). But I can't remember 
many that try to explore the consequences of results from Theoretical
Computer Science -- except for AI, I guess.

It would be fun to see a world where so many things would become
feasable. The lack of digital privacy and Sudoku puzzles would 
definitely be weird, but it seems worth exploring.

Maybe I'll write it one day. But before that, I should probably get
back to studying.
