So google just [dropped their pledge](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy081nqx2zjo) to not use AI for weapons or surveillance...

I hope that this makes it clear to everyone that the tech industry has never
really cared about anyone's interests other than its own profit.

From the Cambridge Analytica scandal, to the devastating consequences of algotithmic
bias and discriminations, to the outright complicity of "Big Tech" companies like
Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people,
technology has always been used by those who own it to exploit, surveil, oppress and
kill.

While technology itself is not the root of all evil, it is far from neutral.
Technology is shaped by the class interests of the bourgeoisie and will continue
to be used to opress us unless we fight against it
